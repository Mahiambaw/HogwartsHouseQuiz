# Which Hogwarts House Do You Belong To?

Testing out a simple quiz app using React and Vite. I'm borrowing some of the questions and answers from this [BuzzFeed Quiz](https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/accurate-af-sorting-quiz). Trying to practice the logic here, not really be creative with the questions and answers!

How to run this project locally:

1. Clone the project.

2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. Run `npm run dev` and launch this front-end only web app in your browser.
